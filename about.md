## Hello!

My name is Sonal. I am a rising RU senior studying computer science with strong interests in the fields of mobile/web dev, bioinformatics, medicine/health, and finance. 
Currently, I am involved in research at the [Sensory and Motor Integration Lab](https://sensorymotorintegrationlab.com) at RU and I love to learn. 

If I am not reading or working on code- I am practicing yoga, lifting, or playing piano. 
I enjoy photography and writing, so feel free to review my featured photography on the homepage and/or my thoughts in the blog tab above!

Please contact me through email for any inquiries on my experience or prices for photoshoots, mobile/website development, yoga private lessons, and/or tutoring.
